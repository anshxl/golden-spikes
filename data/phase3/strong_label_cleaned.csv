jozf8nk,geopolitics,2023-06-21,2419,"exactly, when adam smith first wrote about the wealth of nations, he probably had in mind commercial exchange as a creator of wealth between two countries that traded goods in more or less equal terms. and then david ricardo added the competitive advantages angle, that further explained how efficiency derives from focusing on each ones competitive advantage, which becomes problematic when you compare extractive industries and capital intensive industries as you've mentioned. we know now that the ricardo's model is flawed not just because of that insurmountable barriers of entry into the ""developed"" club, but also because ricardo assumed, among other things, that the costs of transportation and exchange are zero and this is not true: there are enormous environmental costs associated to transportation and fuel consumption - including climate change, which the article mentioned - as well as other social and political opportunity costs that have resulted from dismantling local production and sending it to third countries. the free-trade paradigm of wealth necessarily had to be revised to incorporate the realities on the ground. i don't understand why these pundits are now acting as if the model of global economy was sustainable in the long term. regarding your despair, i believe that the option for poorer countries is to simply assume they will never reach the idea of development proposed by the richer countries and start assuming alternate economic models that focus on the general well-being of their populations: instead of focusing on a baseline measurement of poverty, governments should focus on satisfying people's basic needs: education, health, housing, jobs. i usually bring up max neef's theory of needs which could perfectly address this. these people will be ""poor"" in the sense that they won't have money to buy a bunch of game consoles or last-season clothing or even their own vehicles, but they will be able to live good lives. when a cotton country sends you their cotton but can cut on all the crap that its population ""needs"" and receives in exchange, the playing field starts to level up. that's precisely why the west worries about de-dollarization and alternate partnerships such as brics: it's almost like all the poor people decided to start a trading thing of their own, with blackjack and hookers... that's what we have to be aware of in the coming global economy.",Negative

k7e6805,geopolitics,2023-11-01,8032,"this article from a couple years back does a great job explaining why european opinion has shifted so drastically in israel's favour during the past 15 years. >since the start of this new round of violence between israel and hamas, european leaders have been vocal in expressing their support for israel’s right to defend its citizens. german chancellor angela merkel has called hamas rockets “terrorist attacks,” and the german political class on the left and right, in the midst of a parliamentary campaign, has echoed her support for israel. green candidate and current poll leader annalena baerbock has called israeli security “the national interest of the modern german state.” israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu acknowledged these statements of support, thanking u.s. president joe biden but also european leaders, specifically “the president of france, the british prime minister, the chancellor of austria, the chancellor of germany, and others.” netanyahu added: “they have upheld our natural and self-evident right to defend ourselves, to act in self-defense against these terrorists who both attack civilians and hide behind civilians.” >this was not always the case. eu relations with israel were famously cold for decades. during the second intifada, the eu took pains to counterbalance the george w. bush administration’s embrace of the sharon government. public opinion was hostile. in a 2003 poll that had provoked much controversy, 59 percent of europeans named israel the gravest threat to world peace. protests and calls for boycotts were common. however, the mood is changing. >in recent years, netanyahu has actively cultivated relationships with europe’s leaders, especially on the illiberal side, seeing them as natural allies. hungarian prime minister viktor orban was warmly received in jerusalem in 2018, a visit that was criticized domestically due to the far-right strongman’s history of flirting with antisemitic and holocaust revisionist tropes. other european populist leaders like then-italian deputy prime minister matteo salvini visited israel in 2018. israeli historian zeev sternhell condemned what he viewed as netanyahu’s desire to see himself “as an integral part of this anti-liberal bloc.” but europe’s friendlier tone toward israel can’t be solely explained by netanyahu’s closer relationship with a few illiberal european leaders like orban. all of europe is moving. >a mix of economic, geopolitical, and european domestic reasons can explain this progressive, undeniable shift. >europeans have not changed their official position on the conflict and still uphold the resumption of the peace process, the end of occupation, and a two-state solution under the 1967 borders as the way forward. the eu is the most significant aid provider to the u.n. relief and works agency for palestine refugees in the near east and the palestinian national authority. only the czech republic and hungary have followed through on the trump administration’s move to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel while nine european countries recognize palestine as a state. but the palestinian question has been deprioritized in the overall relationship. >this is first because of the middle east’s changing nature. despite the recent upsurge in violence, it’s rare today to find a european diplomat who would claim the israeli-palestinian issue is the key to unlocking all of the region’s tensions and conflicts, a view held almost religiously in european chancelleries in the 2000s. the 2010 arab spring, the syrian civil war with its consequences in europe (including terror attacks and increased migration), and the iranian nuclear file have all shifted priorities in the middle east. >despite a lukewarm public reception, many european diplomats privately acknowledge the abraham accords have added another nail in the coffin of europe’s focus on israel-palestine. after the accords last year, israeli foreign minister gabi ashkenazi was invited to attend the european council in berlin, the first time such an honor was extended to an israeli diplomat. energy discoveries in the eastern mediterranean have always spurred deep exploitation cooperation among greece, cyprus, israel, and egypt—against the claims of neighboring turkey. in april, athens and jerusalem announced a record $1.65 billion defense contract, following a meeting between foreign ministers of the united arab emirates, greece, cyprus, and israel. >at the same time, israel’s economic and tech performances have started to attract european interest. israel was the first non-european country associated with a string of eu scientific bodies like the framework programmes for research and technological development and the european organization for nuclear research, known as cern. it’s also a part of the eu’s global navigation system galileo. shortly after french president emmanuel macron’s 2017 election, his economy and digital affairs ministers visited tel aviv, israel’s innovation festival, months before the foreign minister visited the country. in 2011, france announced the purchase of $500 million worth of heron drones, breaking with a 44-year arms embargo started by then-french president charles de gaulle after the 1967 six-day war. in 2018, germany followed through after the bundestag agreed to lease israeli drones for nine years, a $1.2 billion contract hailed by netanyahu as “contributing to european security.” in 2020, airbus and two israeli air and space companies were mandated by the eu to fly drones over the mediterranean sea to monitor migrant smuggler ships. >but the main change has come from european societies themselves and is symbolic of something deeper. facing terror attacks in the last few years, europeans have increasingly associated israel as a country facing similar challenges, the canary in the coalmine for european democracies. aurore bergé, a french parliament spokesperson for the la république en marche! party and head of the france-israel friendship group, said: “we have a common front with israel: the struggle against islamist terrorism. more than ever, it’s what brings us closer and what explains the diplomatic shift in europe.” >as atlantic council senior fellow damir marusic put it in a brilliant recent essay, “between brussels and jerusalem,” the two capitals have embodied competing understandings for the west’s sense of history and meaning of world war ii and the holocaust. for the former, the disasters of world war ii called for cooperation, technocratic governance transcending the ills of the nation-state. for jerusalem, the tragic fate of jews in europe urged them to overcome their historic powerlessness and build a strong nation supported by borders and a powerful army. as they integrated the continent, europeans increasingly viewed their successful model as the shape of things to come for the rest of the world. europe was to “run the 21st century,” according to an influential essay by mark leonard. and what better place to apply the european model of reconciliation than in israel-palestine? >but things did not turn out this way. fifteen years ago, it was commonplace for observers to forewarn growing israeli diplomatic isolation if it failed to find a sustainable and peaceful solution to the palestinian issue. these predictions did not come to pass. with europe and the united states, of course, but also with new partnerships in india, russia, and africa, israel has more economic and diplomatic partners than it ever has. meanwhile, with terror attacks; identity and immigration concerns; mainstream eu politicians lamenting inefficient borders; and center-left parties, such as the french socialist party or the german social democratic party, in free fall; europeans are questioning their model. european leaders regularly now call for a geopolitical eu to “speak the language of power.” maybe the sense of history is tilting toward jerusalem, after all?",Positive

f4vqaez,geopolitics,2019-10-23,3433,"this is a loaded question and i would love to read more about what you all think. i am not well enough informed to open a perspective with respect to geopolitics theories. however, i feel that hong kong is an issue separate from your other examples as civil society is terrified of coming under the direct influence of china along with the stripping of rights they now enjoy. as for kashmir, balochistan, kurdistan, khalistan, i would view theses conflicts in the context of difficult economic and social development over the past decades. indeed, ethnic and religious identity movements have found a following due to the poor current and future outlook. the geopolitical implications of control and access to these areas between china, pakistan and india are what make the status quo so difficult to change. one could say that these regions were initially poorly 'divided' and that the lasting effects have led to continuous problems. a 'reordering' of the situation is therefore necessary in order for better administration and social, economic and political cohesion to be possible in the respective nation states. &#x200b; finally, the example of catalonia is the only case you mentioned that, for me, relates to the question of the future of nation states. examples of regions with similar movements or aspirations to those in catalonia could include texas and california in the us and bavaria in germany. some people within these regions, despite enjoying an overall positive economic environment, feel that their inclusion within a nation is not benefiting them as much as going it solo. motivations for this include a historic resentment for the 'rest of the country,' or a superiority or 'specialty' complex which determines that they are different from the rest and entitled to better situations. in some cases, such as tax redistributions from a wealthy state (bavaria) to the rest of the states in germany can be seen as unfair. however, the population, industrial and political influences of the 'stronger', secession-interested states often provide advantages in determining the direction of the entire nation. as an example, consider the case of california's decree on average fuel efficiency affecting the entire country. other times, the effect is less strong such as in the us where the popular vote doesn't lead to winning an election for the president or proportional representation in the senate. &#x200b; at the end of it all, i think it would be useful to rephrase the question as what a nation state is at its core: an assembly of some stronger and some weaker states. the compromise between making the stronger and weaker states remain part of the union is at the core of most real politics. identity movements, while effective among the less well educated, are not as convincing when one must also consider the economic, military and geopolitical implications of a secession. the question of identity should however not be rejected entirely as it remains an important element around which people can form bonds. one should be careful, however, that the regional identity is something one can earn after having lived somewhere for a certain period of time and not something that is formed on the basis of ethnicity, lineage or religion. instead, if one has lived for perhaps 10 years in new york city, one can consider oneself a nooyawkeh. so too should the identities of people be changeable.",Neutral

kd8sa2v,geopolitics,2023-12-13,5911,"basically, it gives you the ability to rapidly lower the costs of orbital infrastructure going forward, potentially reducing costs by a magnitude (if i had to guess), if not more. this gives you some extremely valuable infrastructure that you can use as diplomatic, economic, or military tools to push your agenda. i suppose it's akin to the advent of container shipping, it revolutionizes what we can do in the void. there's a lot of hypothetical technologies that you can only develop in space, something like zblan for instance, would fundamentally change the information industry by making fiber optic cables more transmission capable than any competitors in the same price range. human organs are another one, as are gaas semiconductors or improved silica chips with gallium components, certain parts of drugs, like protein crystals, are of higher quality in space, and tons of stuff i'm missing, that can *only* be done in space, or are more economically viable in space. the moon will be a critical component of near earth industry (nei), and any country serious about its prominence going forward will invest *heavily* in setting up shop there. because, until an exotic form of new atmospheric escape can feasibly be built, such as space hooks, elevators, or magrails, we are at the mercy of the rocket equation. luna gives us the ability to launch heavy components from outposts or colonies at fractions of the cost of earth launches. i'm not sure on specifics here, but given that the moon's gravity is 1/6th that of earth, i'd comfortably say at least half the cost per kilo, and that's massive. i'd hazard and say it's a bigger impact than just a 50/50 cut too, because bulky, heavy material could be launched from luna, while more fragile light components can get the regular launch. so, if you want to build stuff in space, and build it at significantly reduced prices, you need the moon, or better yet, a near earth asteroid. whichever country can successfully utilize the moon and begin industrialization of both lunar and earth orbits will be in a prime position to controll foundational portions of the future earth economy, much like microchips or hydrocarbons do today. if this is done by a single nation, they would be the only country that would qualify as a hyper power, with the entire world's economy reliant upon their industries and technologies. standing in opposition to them would mean developing vastly more expensive methods of producing their tech, and it's not like microchips where you can copy paste. china can steal taiwan semiconductors and replicate them, no problem, but zero countries will be able to steal country x's chips and reproduce them, because it's *physically* out of reach unless they're willing to shell the trillions it takes to build orbital fabs. as for which country, the ones you think will are the ones who will. the us, china, esa, india, and the jaxa appear to be the only nations or group of nations really stretching out their le russia is in a world of shit, and the recent blow to their pedigree from the failed lunar mission is ought to hurt, and from what i can tell, their industry is pretty decrepit, having the same loss of funding post collapse as the military, this is why i'm not including them. there are wildcards too, which i think might be able to do something interesting, such as the uae, south korea, and brasil. besides that, there will also be countries which benefit from proximity to the equator, i suspect places like panama or columbia will have a thriving space port due to their proximity to international trade choke points and the equator. but the reality is that for near term colonization, the us is by far the most likely to achieve it. the us, as in most aspects, is a leviathan in this field, directly controlling or hosting a company which controls, more than *half* of the world's satellites, has half of the worlds space based companies (10x more than closest competitor, uk), has access to multiple heavy lift vehicles capable of moving colonization equipment, and has a pedigree that no other nation can really match in terms of experience *and* accomplishments, or at least volume of success. the us could decide tomorrow it wanted a permanent presence on the moon and have a fully functional base on shackleton crater with dozens of personnel before 2030, they have that kind of advantage. of course, they won't say that, and will plod along in the lead until they get a fire under them, which brings up: china. china's lunar plans partly relied on russia being its partner for a joint moon base in 2035, who is unlikely going to shell out billions for a colony in the near future. they do have several reusable rockets in development, with successful launches, but they're behind, and economic constraints currently being experienced by china may hamper fledgling space companies from getting off the ground. but if any country *could* give the us a run for its money, it's definitely china. both china and the us are in a league all their own, but there is potential for others to join. india is one of, if not the only country that could match us economic power in this century, and if they were to invest in growing their space agency and stimulating private sector, they may start rapidly becoming a main competitor to china and the us, although i'd hope the us and india could jointly go forward. i do not think japan, korea, or the esa could compete against the above three, simply due to limitations to their economies in the case of korea and japan, but also due to bureaucracy and indecision that plagues the eu and therefore the esa. individually, players like france, germany, or the uk may play roles, and potentially form a more effective conglomerate focused on space colonization, but i'm not holding my breath. tl;dr: moon gib much advantage at industry. us most likely to lead.",Positive

eyn5i2p,geopolitics,2019-08-31,2676,"right. to your first paragraph. what seems to be undeniable is that israel hit two of the men trained to handle these drones. it seems nasrallah was speaking the truth that they did indeed hit a hezbollah r&r center where these two were residing, judging from the pool the target hit. so the truth of that strike to me is a mix of both narratives: israel hit two hezb operatives trained and prepared to use drones on israel while staying at an r&r center owned by the party. but if the story ended there, there would be an uptick in tension and not a war scare. the make or break issue is the concurrent attack on beirut. this shows israel consciously taking a risk towards war for a non-immediately pressing security issue. that's why my perception is 'israel is pushing buttons' this time, unlike say 2006 which is a war no side expected or 2015 which was an accident that was handled within the 'rules'. >without this important piece of information conclusion of the reader is that israel must be war mongering at this time. war mongering is not a word i like. it exudes irrationality and bloodthirst. that's not what i'm aiming for. i'm saying simply given the two crossed red lines and the israeli response after they were crossed, israel is ready to do the dirty work regarding hezbollah's missile program. as i said in my r/lebanon comment, it looks much better internationally and domestically if a war starts after a hezbollah response. (to a much smaller extent domestically. my experience is that it's hard to pull a fast one on the israeli people.) to quote myself, >c) israel crossed two red lines in one weekend. the reasonable conclusion one can make is that they're baiting hezbollah into a war as soon as the hezb enforces the red lines it set. ""israel defends itself from unwarranted hezb aggression"" looks much better internationally than ""israel strikes beirut, triggering war."" and yes, i agree that the israeli establishment has been very clear that a war with hezbollah will hurt. (like the 'no coffee in tel aviv' statements.) as i said in another comment, this is the main reason i'm holding out some hope for peace. but your point is well taken, so i'll qualify it with israel achieving a 'relatively' tidy victory. >but it also understands that the longer this war is put off the worst it would be. that's the sentiment behind my 'rapidly closing window' logic. i even think the establishment believes it's been put off for *too long*. even the poor people of the south, some of who i know are already extremely nervous, have been saying ""it's been over 10 years without a war. we always felt it was too good to be true.""",Neutral

jmr0gl8,geopolitics,2023-06-03,2872,"this makes it sound more positive than the actual situation is. energy prices in europe have become a permanent problem and it is causing real pain that isn't going away. the eurozone has experienced record breaking inflation numbers for at least 7-8 months now, energy was one of the largest contributers. the german statistical office at one point had energy at roughly 30% compared y-o-y. producer prices have skyrocketed in the entire manufacturing and agricultural sector. for example fertilizer prices have exploded over the summer last year while at the same time a lot of the larger european ammonium production plants like those of yara had to run at half capacity because of the energy price explosion at that time. the insecurity of energy prices have contributed to large parts of the european industry complaining that european industrial viability in energy-heavy sectors like the chemical processing industry might be permanently damaged. if you compare the german electricity futures on the eex market with some american futures, the price gap is almost 200% - german futures hover around 100-150€/mwh, reaching peaks of 300€/mwh last summer. the french futures aren't exactly that much lower, trading at around 80-120€ while american futures are around $40-60/mwh. meanwhile, the race to the bottom in regards to subsidy programs is causing another front of pain opening up for europe. basf for example has announced it will permanently reduce the size of their european operations in favor of american and asian locations. the american ira, while not really directly aiming at european industry, is causing capital investment drain in europe nonetheless in a situation, where it's pulled in all directions. to not lose out, the eu as a whole is basically forced into a subsidy race that is hard to sustain given its multiple overlapping crises. all of this is causing a permenant hobble on the competitiveness of the european industry compared to the us and china. at the same time, renewable energy expansion also means that europe is merely shifting its dependence. the renewable energy industrial machine relies on scalability and resources that europe cannot provide on its own - it will have to partially rely on others to expand their renewable energy transition. chinese industrial capacity and their cheaply scalable production lines (for example in pv panel production) are basically half-carrying the ability of european economies, especially the smaller ones to get away cheaply, creating another dependence. this is probably also the reason why the eu was overall less china-hawkish compared to the us when it was all about ""decoupling"", the message that is now parroting all across the west is ""derisking"" instead of ""decoupling"" which the eu member states probably had a hand in as their message was ""derisking"" in the first place.",Negative

the idea that the tribute is 'forced' is nonsense. china pays more than the typical price for incoming tribute, in fact, china limits the amount of tribute mission in order to reduce the inflated prices china must pay, but countries ignored it because it is in their interest to pay tribute to china. it's nonsensical to present the tribute when one has not studied the tributary system. now it's far from me to say palmela kyle crossley is a bad source about modern china, i do find it difficult to believe this particular view since her expertise was modern china, and not china as a whole or chinese history during the 13th century onward. she mentioned >the relationships performed were between the son of heaven and the outside sovereigns — not their respective societies — and chinese records were always explicit about that. the chinese, funnily enough, does not separate sovereign from their people, nor the other people in ea. a society modeled after the confucian sphere really does not have room for 'respective societies'. the interesting part about 'not their societies' is rather strange given we have explicit writings about this arrangement from korea and vietnam on the effect of their world. we don't know what the commoners think since very few gentries seek to discuss the opinions of the common people, but from the writings left to us by the gentry, they, in general, view it as a hierarchical society. now, one thing to be explicit is that the hierarchy is about culture, and the hierarchical order is based on culture. a 14th century poem by nguyen co phu went like this to this distant domain which desires to be transformed official word has come i will sincerely report our fief's efforts when i visit the celestial court the benevolence we bathe in is as if come from a golden goblet brimming to the rim already the radiance seems so close as i set off to receive his moral blessings in this distant wilderness, we will joyfully maintain this enterprise for ages to come &#x200b; liam kelley describes the relationship as one that is unequal between the northern celestial court and the vietnamese court, as this was poetry written by a vietnamese official, it would be strange to find him describing this northern-southern relationship as such unless he actually believes it. in fact, a tribute vietnam sent in 1156 describes it as 'the tribute is rich and all the characters in the letters written with gold. there were 1,200 taels of gold wares, half of them decorated with pearls or valuables; 100 pears contained in gold vases, of which three were as big as eggplants... imperial horses complete with saddles, plus the regular tribute of eight horses and five elephants. the envoys were quite proud of being able to bring so rich a tribute.' according to tana's a view from the sea. kelly further wrote 'for while the existing scholarship has accustomed us to think southern envoys as proud believers in their own importance who only 'posed' as tribute bearers.... their minds may have been filled with quite contrary thoughts. rather than seeking to demonstrate that 'vietnam' was civilised' so that the 'chinese would not invade, southern envoys may have harbored other thoughts and intentions when they journey to the north.' &#x200b; and that is based on the chinese commitment to not exploit the fellow states. as stated earlier, economically speaking, china avoids the impression of exploitation in any form and was willing to pay much-inflated prices for goods to ensure that no one could accuse her of exploitation. that is the key way to how the system worked. &#x200b; &#x200b; so granted, this argument is a strawman argument. it set up a ridiculous tribuatory system that never existed, then challenged that system that was never there. on the other hand, they seek to dismiss the real relationship between the ea states, some of them loosely, other more closely such as vietnam and korea, about the real dialogue that was there. so yes, there were no nation-state policies like the league of nations in the 14th century, but there very much was a westphalian system like system there in the 14th century. states were able to discuss with states on stately matters, such as borders, tribute, economic trade, defenses, etc, through a similar cultural and understanding of the confucian sphere. to dismiss it is to commit some terrible bad history.",Negative

heboxum,geopolitics,2021-09-26,3701,"> i think that the chinese government is recognising this is a severe problem that china will face. and this is why their changing many of their education, labour, and housing policies to alleviate many of these external stressors that discourage couples from having children. contrary to what others believe, it's not just about whether the government is pursuing a two- or three-child policy. whether these policies will be successful is very much an open question. true. encouraging a higher birthrate comes down to taking the pressure off young couples who are faced with taking care of kids (which are expensive to raise) and elders (which are large in number). the chinese government has several advantages in dealing with this and many of the other situations they face. the first is the flexibility they have to craft policy measures. the second is their long-term orientation, partly cultural and partly due to a lack of constraints that a four-year election cycle would place on them. and the third is their competency, as officials move up the ranks of government based on their ability to accomplish critical objectives rather than their ability to win a popularity contest with the public. as you've said, it is an open question, but they have significant advantages and an incentive to keep their citizens happy. no one has a crystal ball, of course. > as for the citizens' perception of the ccp government, most of it was due to the alleviation of poverty and general economic growth. the world bank estimates that, since 1978, china has lifted over 800 million people out of poverty: see here. this is a rate of growth that is unprecedented in history. the ccp's legitimacy is built on the foundation of raising the general welfare of people in this respect. i would agree with that, and this is one thing that a lot of people in the ""west"" don't seem to understand. that over the last 40 years, people in china have continually seen their lives get better. > but to say that this kind of bullish growth will continue is slightly more optimistic that the way i see it. remember that 1978 was the year when deng xiaoping took over and instituted a series of market-economy reforms. a lot of this is driven by external trade and investment. what xi jinping is slowly steering the economy towards is domestic growth. whether that will succeed is very much an open question. yes, i would say that the same level of growth will not continue forever. however, there are other factors that can keep a population happy. i would take a broader view and say that any improvements, in general, that people can feel in their lives will increase satisfaction levels. for example, having lived through the entirety of the pandemic in china, i can see that people's opinions of their government are probably higher than ever. they are comparing the number of people who are infected and dying inside of china (extremely small) to the number in other, more developed countries (high), and this creates a sense of pride and confidence. so, i would say that having a high state capacity is an important factor in winning over the public as well. > and i think that a lot of the ""wolf warrior"" diplomacy revealed a certain insecurity within the ccp. it was completely counterproductive because it cultivated a hostile image for china. i'm glad that they are abandoning this style of diplomacy recently. i think the ""wolf warrior"" label is a bit unfair. i see it as simply pushing back on an antagonistic us (my country), whereas in the past they might not have. that being said, there may be a certain level of insecurity, but i also see insecurity in the us and with its allies.",Neutral

kiev. its focused not just on becoming energy independent but also solidified its ability to be a top exporter for decades to come. its finally addressing the shift in global dynamics and in 2 key regions it has started to take the needed actions to stop a nation from securing regional hegemony. with china it has finally accepted that the leaders of the ccp have been waging an economic war against the u.s for the last decade and a half, and has been trying to lush the u.ss influence out of the region. by upping our commitment to taiwan, getting a new trade deal with japan as well as pressuring them to increase their military, weve signed a new deal with s.k and together weve started trying to draw n.k away from china with them signing the peace agreement and us trying to get them to buy into the prosperity that comes with joining our side. weve stepped away from the phillipines to an extent because their government has taken a dark turn and is actively letting itself get trapped by chinas debt trap. in the me we have stopped trying to fight pointless battle and started focusing on irans proxy network and have stopped being distracted by the nukes. irans ability to use proxy groups to gain governmental power in multiple countries in the region should be applauded as it was very well done, not just because it was successful but because america got occupied in conflicts of little importance while iran swooped in without having to invade anyone. the support you see for s.a and israel from the u.s government isnt because of lobbying or corruption, its because the only way the u.s can stop iran from controlling the region while also stopping china from controlling sea is if s.a and israel work together to push back, s.a has the money and governmental freedom to attack whatever target they want, israel has the military competence that s.a lacks. weve made sure if the world goes to hell we can stay out of it and still be relatively just as well off as now by integrating canada and mexico even more in our economic production. canada is our backup fuel supply, mexico is our factory and farm labor, we are their investment, bank account and global projector. the u.s is the only nation on earth today and in history that has total control of the earths oceans, meaning we get to decide just how open the sea trade routes are, and we can invade anyone while no one can invade us. weve also started to take steps to ensure we control space and its resources to whatever extent is possible with our dedicating a service specifically for space and setting up a legal frame work for asteroid mining. weve also distanced ourselves from the e.u to an extent while welcoming the u.k with open arms. the reason trump hasnt placated the e.u so theyd help with china, nor did he care about the affect pulling out of the iran would have on them is because they refuse to acknowledge the reality of their current place in the world, much like france and u.k before the suez crisis they have failed to see theyve are no longer a leading entity. when they do accept that under the current administration and quite possibly future ones that we are willing to let them crumble under turkish and russian agression as well as chinese influence then they will probably be back in our alliance but on our terms, not like now where they are under the impression that they are equals in terms of economic and political power. france may be the acception since our intertwined history would have the public pissed at the government if we dont try and keep them from falling to far. but currently germany refuses to understand that they cant have an economy that is almost entirely dependent on trade that props up russia and hurts southern and eastern e.u members. the people in the news arent interested in the nuance and the pragmatic workings of geopolitics. it doesnt sell, and both the e.u and china (mostly china) have a lot of influence in the mainstream media we all see, so a lot of what you see is from a perspective that understands they cant go around reporting about the darker side of germanys economic might, or the true depths of divide within the e.u and before 2018 it wasnt normal to see constant negative articles about china, however that certianly has changed recently and in response weve also seeing an uptick in media outlets spreading chinese propaganda. its not so much trump was more forward thinking than our previous presidents so much as clinton was mostly a domestic minded president, bush only managed to focus on 1 region of geopolitics and was knee capped by both incompetence and the financial crisis. obama had to spend most of his energy on fixing the mess bush left behind, and for some reason was convinced by someone that making a deal with iran on nukes would somehow address a situation that had little to do with nukes. but obama did manage to stop the damage bush unleashed, and when trump came in the shale industry was primed to give the u.s energy independence and financially we were in a position to be aggressive with china, and trump had enough political capital and disregard for typical practice to tell the e.u they were going to be treated like any other trade partner, only mexico and canada kept their special status although they had to sign american friendly deals. and in reality america is almost in as good a position as 91 as far as foriegn control and domestic growth are concerned, with the only difference being rise of the e.u and china in the 3 decades that had

g9jfhfp,geopolitics,2020-10-21,3407,"i'd like to put a special focus on wolfe's comments about how the us under trump has failed to mobilize allies properly because of trump's nationalist and america first agenda. you hear this a lot, and i think it is a bit inaccurate. there can be no doubt that trump's lack of finesse as a diplomat and his general demeanor hinder us diplomatic efforts to constrain china. but a lot of this is about style (which does matter) rather than substance. many of the claims of us 'bullying' are a bit misplaced. the truth is that china is not primarily a us problem. the us does not view china as a problem simply because china is a potential contender for the #1 spot in national power. this is a convenient canard thrown around by other nations to characterize china's rise as an american issue so that they can justify trying to free-ride off of america, letting america try to handle china on its own dime. most countries are somewhat nationalistic and have a ""germany first' or 'france first' or even 'japan first' attitude whenever they can get away with it. it's only america that is supposed to subordinate its interests to the good of the whole more than other nations do, supposedly as some type of price to pay for the status of being world leader. well trump's main point, and one one which i believe he is correct, is that the us is not going to keep paying a disproportionate amount to solve the world's problems just because it is the most powerful nation. this cold war is not going to be paid for on the same terms as the last one. a lot of what people think of as 'working with us allies' actually means doing it the old way: the us bribes other countries with better trade deals than they would normally get so that such countries align their security policies with the us. or in this case, align their trade/economic polices with the us with respect to china. i think the us is done with that model, and replacing trump is not going to change that. this is not working with allies but working for them. i agree that given its wealth, the us should pay more to solve problems than other countries. and not just in aggregate because the same % cost applied over a larger total yields a higher aggregate amount. more like the progressive tax system: it's fair for the us to pay an even higher % rate than other countries. i think the us is good with that too: but within limits. the us is already paying that higher marginal rate and more with just its defense spending and the global common goods this provides. there is no need to tack on sweetheart trade deals with allies on top of that. the key thing is that the other nations of the world have to understand that to the degree china is considered a problem, it is everybody's problem equally and not just an american problem. in fact, one can easily argue that america is most immune to the impact of china's rise, isolated as it is in fortress america replete with most of the key resources. so the developed world should come together to work on the china issue. to the extent that some countries truly do not believe china is a problem, or truly believe that cooperation with china is the best solution, so be it. but to the extent that they truly don't believe this, but hope that by taking this approach the us will feel bound to do the heavy lifting for them, allowing them to free-ride and play both sides, then shame on them.",Positive

jc2d4q5,geopolitics,2023-03-13,2964,"> it's a common sentiment among politicians and commentators here in denmark. wars like afghanistan and iraq were major errors, and the west's military will likely only engage in significant conflicts if nato's article 5 is invoked in the future, with taiwan potentially being an exception. afghanistan was a direct response to 9/11 and unless al qaeda does another massive terrorist attack, it likely will not recur. it's only if a nation is unable to properly combat extremism and allow a massive terrorist attack to occur like 9/11 will it happen again. iraq on the other hand was universally seen as a disaster by all western nations, and you also have germany and france who were against it from the get go; but that's why the west thrives. because the wests entire principle is around being able to disagree and criticising each other so we can improve things. if politicians and commentators in denmark only have some 20 year old wars to point to as criticisms then i have to say the west is doing pretty damn well. in terms of trade, the west were the basis for the globalised system; and i don't ever see that going away entirely. even if the west disintegrates and america stops being the hegemon, china is entirely reliant on globalism to continue existing; who honestly wants globalism to stop? the west may attempt to use certain levers as sticks to make countries act the way they want them to, but i don't see this is an end to global trade; its just a short term policy. > this is why many western nations do not care about the deaths of migrants in qatar, the torture of uighurs in china, or the repression of women in iran. we care, but its not our responsibility to fix. i think after iraq and the whole world police thing not working out, i am not sure we would attempt to do anything beyond some words and perhaps minor policy decisions. certainly nothing like embargoes or invasions. > the foundation of western values lies in democracy, freedom of expression, and a certain degree of egalitarianism, as well as specific social norms and ethical values associated with the west. perhaps it's a form of superiority complex, but i'd assume that most populations would desire the benefits of such a framework, e.g. a sustainable democracy. however, creating the necessary infrastructure to support such a framework can be quite challenging. well said, its also cultural too. its hard to invent a culture of openness and transparency where one of opacity and fear existed before. i think this was largely the case with russia, when in the early 2000s even putin was saying he hoped one day to join nato; and when it became clear that putin was not making any real changes but instead centralising and consolidating power further instead of fixing courts and justice systems etc. i think its largely a cultural thing. cultures however can change, but i have no clue how to change them if small sticks and small carrots don't work.",Positive

g17ssc5,geopolitics,2020-08-12,4942,"so far, the responses have been very complacent. for my part, i prefer to question your perspective: was the british empire really that powerful? on what basis do you define its power? wealth? all right, but not all colonies and trade routes were equal in terms of wealth.the beginning of the european expansion initiated by the portuguese in the 15th century did not shift the centre of gravity of the trade routes in the immediate future: the mediterranean, and therefore the ottoman empire, was still at the centre of trade at least until the 17th century. so, just to put things into perspective, just before the first world war, the united kingdom was indeed the leading trading power, but it was closely followed by germany, whose colonial empire was relatively modest: **germany :** total foreign trade in 1898 : 323,585,000 in 1912 : 982,615,000 total increase : 659,030,000 **uk :** total foreign trade in 1898 : 558,100,000 in 1912 :1,120,125,000 total increase : 562,025,00 source: [ colouring a quarter of the world on a map does not mean that the territories in question are necessarily producers of wealth. in 1913, the united states had become the leading economic power in terms of gdp. and it also allows me to remind you of a common mistake we europeans make: we tend to believe that europe has always been the centre of the world. in reality, before the industrial revolution, wealth production was mainly determined by the number of arms available. this is why past gdp projections always point to asia, whose demography was already larger than ours, as the economic lung of the world. in other words, if we use wealth production as a basis for determining a centre of gravity, it must be said that it was never in europe before the industrial revolution. europe will undoubtedly and objectively become the centre of the world during the 19th century and up to the first half of the 20th century, but historically it was asia, at least if we base ourselves on this indicator. since we are in a geopolitical forum, i think it is important not to ask such open and oriented questions. of course, geography is important, but you shouldn't be exalted because you've planted your flag on gigantic territories, even less so when these territories are sparsely populated. a perfect example of this problem is the colonisation of africa. before the berlin conference, barely 10% of the african territory (source - in french: [ was actually colonized. yes, the different political maps showed different geographical layouts in favour of the european powers, but in reality, colonisation was low. the lack of technological means such as electricity, telegrams, railways, etc. made transport, communications and the industrialisation of space difficult. as an anecdote, brazil, then a portuguese colony in 1600, had about 100,000 inhabitants. the kingdom of bohemia, under the authority of the emperor of the holy roman empire elected by the prince electors, had more than a million inhabitants. this allows me to point out that while the united kingdom dominated the seas, or at least some of the world's seas, its position on the continent was often fragile, forcing it to systematically build systems of alliance. in short, your question in your thread is too broad. what is really impressive about the united kingdom is that before the 19th century, it was a very sparsely populated country, with a very low manpower: and despite this, it managed to build a gigantic empire. this reminds me of the kingdom of portugal, which was the engine of european exploration and conquest, bypassing the ottomans and the chinese. to this question that i ask myself, i would indeed take up the elements of the answer given by others: control of the oceans, and by extension of trade routes. at the end of the day, small populated country can have a disproportionate influence depending their geography, ressources, industry, etc. on the other hand, i absolutely dispute your exaltation of the british empire as the leading world power, even though the united kingdom has never been the leading continental power in europe. the continental power in europe after rome and the carolingian empire was contested between the kingdom of france, the holy roman empire of germany, habsburg spain in personal union with the holy roman empire, the kaiserreich and russia according to the times. if you want to exalt an empire for its absolute domination, you are lucky because you are a contemporary of the american domination. the united states is a historical anomaly: never before has a political entity been so dominant both in terms of intensity and space.",Neutral

the question is when and in what manner.” lotay is no longer in office, having lost the election earlier this year, but his successor, tshering tobgay, has stuck to the same line. china has emerged as bhutan’s biggest trading partner, surpassing india. while the chinese power corporation is involved in major hydel projects in the country, the chinese railway company is exploring railway connections through a link between two major tibetan towns, lhasa and gyantse. the modi government recently proposed the construction of a motorable road connecting tawang in arunachal pradesh and gauhati in assam through bhutan, but thimphu is not enthusiastic about the proposal until its border with china is demarcated. bhutan does not even acknowledge, let alone object to, the construction of chinese well-off villages in its territory. at the end of the doklam crisis, the indian prime minister, narendra modi, sought an informal summit with china’s president, xi jinping, to do a china reset. two such meetings were held—one at wuhan in 2018 and the other at chennai in 2019. both leaders agreed to provide strategic guidance to their respective militaries but to little effect, as the events of 2020 were to prove. in june that year, india and china recorded the death of indian soldiers in the galwan valley in ladakh. these were the first military casualties on the line of actual control in forty-five years. all this while, many indian analysts had continued to hail the government and the military for standing up to china, that too inside bhutan. beijing saw it differently. in a 2017 analysis of the doklam crisis, the pla’s western theatre command asserted that the aim was “to make india succumb without a confrontation between the two armies,” adding that the approach served lessons “for future struggles.” beijing has learned lessons from doklam and applied them well to the ladakh border crisis. and the modi government, by no longer asking for a return to status quo as it existed before may 2020, or restoration of full patrolling rights for indian soldiers, has succumbed to chinese designs. the former foreign secretary vijay gokhale argued that “hardening global perceptions about beijing might create opportunities for fresh bilateral approach,” foreseeing a new political move after the indian general elections. since doklam, others have echoed the call for a “china reset” as well, but, as recently as february this year, the defence secretary giridhar aramane hailed india for standing up to china “on almost all fronts.” doing the same thing and expecting a different result may be a definition of insanity, but with its timidity and fear of escalation, the modi government has cornered itself into a box of poor options against china. its quiver is full of broken arrows. the answer lies in jaishankar’s reasoning for the modi government not making any aggressive move against china, which he offered on a podcast last year. “look, they are the bigger economy. what am i going to do? as a smaller economy, i am going to pick up a fight with the bigger economy? it is not a question of being reactionary, it’s a question of common sense.” pakistan has a similar imbalance vis-à-vis india, and it has chosen to equalise it by a threat of nuclear weapons, by use of asymmetric warfare and by borrowing power from countries like china and saudi arabia, having forged alliances with them. jaishankar’s common sense demands that new delhi will have to do something similar vis-à-vis beijing. for reasons of global censure, india is unlikely to indulge in nuclear sabre-rattling against china. the military component of the so-called tibet card no longer exists to provide viable means of waging asymmetric warfare against china. borrowing power from other more powerful countries is the only thing the modi government is left with.",Negative

l8r7jx0,geopolitics,2024-06-15,3872,"i hope you are right. however, the wildcard is the media environment we are living in. media has shifted away over the past five years or so from reporting news to facilitating narratives (political calculations vs. ""just the facts""). the shaping of public perception is very often implemented by means of omission and if not omission only briefly reporting an important development and then moving on as if to suggest it is of very little importance. as an example, bank failures continue to take place with very little attention by media, presumably to avoid spooking depositors. the u.s. now has a debt-to-gdp ratio of \~122%. leaked audio from the fdic a year or so back suggests that they are contemplating ""bail ins"" in which depositors' money is confiscated by financial institutions. the fdic only holds about .72 of every depositors' dollar they are pledged to cover. in an election. year, it's of no benefit to an incumbent to highlight — whether it's the persistence of inflation, russian warships and nuclear subs off the coast of florida or the saudi's move away from the petrodollar — that we are in an extraordinarily precarious condition financially and geopolitically. for more than a year, the bls has revised jobs numbers downward but not before victory laps are taken in the headlines to bolster the perception that the economy has rebounded after the covid-19 pandemic. as the saying goes, ""the devil is in the details"". of the jobs created, many are part time and reportedly half are going to non-citizens. polls have shown that many americans believe we are already in a recession. jp morgan chase ceo jamie dimon has repeatedly sounded the alarm over the past two years. even president biden stated in march of last year that he anticipated a recession but he was oddly specific about the timing — not in 2023. all of this no doubt played a role in the saudi decision even if domestic media has largely ignored it. if trump is elected, no doubt we (via media) will have a much more ""honest"" conversation. we an expect, after all, that media will work overtime to pin blame on the administration's handling of the economy — but for now we are seeing media and the political establishment work to downplay public concerns as little more than ""fake news"", probably in effort to prop up markets. regardless of who takes office in 2025, however, there is only so long the seriousness of the situation can be minimized. given that we are not living in a particularly transparent media environment — a ""fake it till you make it"" approach to maintaining confidence in the economy — i don't think we can assume the saudi-us agreement will be renewed and/or that they won't align with brics. as for the situation with russia, one of the under-appreciated factors in collapsing the soviet union — said to be the ""gas station of europe"" — was the falling price of oil. today, despite sanctions, high oil prices (sales to china, india, etc.) are propping up the russian economy and their war efforts in ukraine. by contrast, newsweek reported in 2014 upon the annexation of crimea that russia is ""again vulnerable on energy"". at the time the newsweek piece was published, president obama, sec. clinton and others were in broad agreement that our national security was best served by ""energy independence"". that independence came to fruition on trump's watch as a net exporter of oil. thanks to the efforts biden has made to ""phase out"" fossil fuel in the name of combating climate crisis, oil prices have gone up significantly — in parallel with inflation. what newsweek called a ""playbook"" that helped bankrupt the ussr under reagan via cheap oil is now running in reverse. the poles have flipped and now the u.s., with neither cheap oil nor the assumption of petrodollar dominance, is the country arguably in danger of collapse in the decade ahead.",Negative

ijfn1xz,geopolitics,2022-08-08,3980,"great intervention, although i have issue with the following statement ""the ccp are more ultra-nationalists than they are communists."" if you read carefully what they write, the ccp's line of action can clearly be grounded in a ""communist"" reading. i was actually amazed at how well-read many officials are on the matter. many of the thinkers they quote are from the western tradition, and i was surprised to see the likes of gramsci, marcuse, adorno being quoted seamlessly in some articles. of course, the current system draws very little from marx himself (for whom nationalism was nothing but a bourgeois ideology), but the current line of xi jinping thought for the new era or ""socialism with chinese characteristics based on mao zedong thought"" can be traced back to lenin and mostly stalin's idea of statehood and socialism. i think western scholars often make bold statements about the ccp and its ""fake communism"", but it is often out of ignorance and disdain for marxism in general and chinese intellectuals in particular. it is, i believe, a big mistake that tends to portray chinese geopolitical decisions as irrational and emotional when they are often telegraphed and painfully explained with heavy theoretical frameworks. in that respect, when you characterize the annexation as one of an ""other country"", for example, you fall short on the reasoning behind the ""reunification"" narrative of the ccp. same, you state that ""\[i\]nvading taiwan would also come at an enormous economic cost"" or that there ""is absolutely no political appetite to start killing their own people"", and i think you undervalue the important ideological aspects in what are the remnants of a civil war. when you look at xi jinping's speech at the 2017 congress, you can see that he relies on nationalism as an emotional argument, stating that taiwanese are from the ""same blood"", but the wording also tells a story rooted in marxist anti-imperialism : ""all activities of splitting the motherland will be resolutely opposed by all the chinese people. we have firm will, full confidence, and sufficient capability to defeat any form of **taiwan independence secession plot**. we will never allow any person, any organization, or any political party to split any part of the chinese territory from china at any time or in any form."" the problem with taiwan is not that a rogue island slips away with technology that the mainland wants or that its secession is shameful for the national narrative. in a marxist logic, the island's political divergence is a ""plot"" to divide china, an avant-garde of imperialism impeding china from further development. it is, in short, an existential threat. it is not a question about cost and benefits, it is a question of feasibility. there is no ""economic cost"" or ""human cost"" that can cloud the necessity for the ccp to find a solution to the taiwan problem. the only question here is about the means. true to marxist thought about the historical inevitability of a classless society, many have argued over the years for a slow approach to the question, thinking that sharing economical infrastructures (what liberal thinkers call ""economical integration"") would lead to a shift in ideological superstructure of taiwan (and to reunification). this didn't happen, and the island is drifting further away. xi is therefore pointing towards another narrative : this shift in ideological superstructure is not possible because of the intervention of the imperialist powers in ""china's internal affairs"". in that case, there are less options remaining and military intervention becomes a much more likely outcome. note that there is absolutely no question of public opinion in this explanation : communists don't care about public opinion, they believe in historical forces, and that the masses often are misguided or manipulated. in this case a ""force"" - western imperialism - is acting on taiwan, and the soft means to prevent it seem to be dwindling.",Neutral

""no military has ever implemented any of these practices in war before."" ""the idf has also air-dropped flyers to give civilians instructions on when and how to evacuate, including with safe corridors. "" israel has dropped over 520,000 pamphlets, and broadcast over radio and through social media messages to provide instruction for civilians to leave combat areas.""

i0etj0p,geopolitics,2022-03-12,3071,"this is obviously an important response to the other mess of a thread alleging, based off very loose sourcing, that israel suggested to ukraine that it surrender. both ukraine and israel have both denied it officially. this top advisor to zelensky likewise denied it publicly, saying israel actually pushed on *russia* to be more realistic. now wonder why it is that outlets have been publishing the false story based on such loose sourcing. normally two sources are required at minimum, and more if it’s a sensitive issue, but here just one “senior official” gave the claim anonymously. also wonder who was motivated to leak it. my guesses: 1) one possibility is that this was part of the larger propaganda war between russia and ukraine. russia is trying to push, online at least, that ukraine’s resistance is pointless and that it should give up. perhaps it has a ukrainian official on its side that wanted to say another country is pushing this narrative, ie israel as it mediates. this seems unlikely to me, however, because the call was a private one between bennett and zelensky, which means someone in zelensky’s closest circle would have to know about the call *and* support surrender and/or russia. this seems unlikely given he’d probably be dead if he had a traitor that close. then again, maybe that’s why ukraine claims he’s survived a dozen assassination attempts, if someone is constantly informing on him. 2) my personal more-likely guess is that someone in ukraine wants israel to send weapons and support. israel has refrained to this point, sending humanitarian aid and condemning the invasion, but keeping a measured tone because russia controls syria’s skies. too much criticism, or weapons to ukraine, could lead russia to close them to israel, which would make it hard for israel to strike the advanced weapons hezbollah is trying to add more and more of to their arsenal. the un is clearly useless on this front and has failed to disarm or even monitor hezbollah buildup consistently, and no one else seems to want to get involved to prevent iranian arms flowing to hezbollah (or even challenge russian dominance of the skies there, of course), so israel is stuck between the terrorist group to its north getting even stronger more quickly as it sends weapons to ukraine that others are already sending, or doing what it has and trying to walk the line. but ukraine seems to want both criticism of russia and weapons while also making israel mediator, which indicates to me a rift either internally in zelensky’s team, or even just confusion on their own part. zelensky has himself called on israel to offer more fervent support, but then praised its ability to mediate and called on negotiations to be held in jerusalem, which is only possible if it doesn’t offer that support. i’ll be frank, i’m not sure what the play is here. but definitely interesting to watch how far and wide this misinformation spread. naturally the response by all levels of both sides’ governments has been completely underreported, and gotten way less attention.",Neutral

fgzsfyp,PoliticalDiscussion,2020-02-08,2382,"sorry for the rambling. it's pretty clear following this process that biden's time was 2016 not 2020. and i say that as a democrat who still plans to vote for him and thinks he has the best odds of defeating trump. idk watching biden in 2015-2016 vs biden now he has clearly lost a lot of spirit, sharpness and energy and it shows when he campaigns. he still has many good moments, but there are a lot more moments where his age begins to show or where he looks uninterested. i think had biden ran in 2016, he would have won the nomination (even with sanders in the primary). i think one of the primary reasons sanders ran in 2016 is because there was literally 0 credible opposition to hillary. it is no secret he wanted warren to run in 2016. had biden made his intent to run early, i think it would have made it a significantly easier pill for sanders and the progressive wing to swallow. it may be hard to believe given the rhetoric between the sanders and biden campaigns now, but there is a level of comrodary that exists between those two that simply never existed between bernie and hillary. i think sanders would respect biden's progressive credentials way more than he ever did hillary's, making it less likely for him to rum and as a result a possibility that the party isn't as divided as it is now. i also think had biden gotten the nomination you would have saw more movement and endorsements from republicans against trump than you did with hillary. because biden has a good track record from his time in senate (as vp, and long tenured senator) of being pragmatic and bipartisan. hillary has always been divisive and the anti-thesis for republicans, so even the ""never-trumpers"" were never going to jump on board her candidacy. i also think his story with his son beau, would have been such an amazing feel good story on the campaign trail, that voters would have eaten up, and given his campaign a sense of purpose and meaning that his 2020 campaign kind of lacks right now. especially when you consider the fact that one of the last things beau told his father was that he should run for president. i don't blame biden not for running in 2016. bit it is clear to me in retrospect that 2016 was a huge missed opportunity for him and democrats. it seriously makes me wonder how much the party apparatus really did to clear the field for hillary. edit: grammar",Negative

ghfb0s4,PoliticalDiscussion,2020-12-29,5876,"i’m going to try and respond to the spirit because this was a lot. it’s starting to seem like we are debating nihilism versus optimism at the end of it. but truthfully, i largely agree with you about a lot of things when it comes to the state of our government and society. where i think we differ is in the totality of character as opposed to cherry picking line items. to me, the damage, legal or not, that president trump has done to our institutions through personnel and policy alike and his lack of curiosity or any seeming regard for the constitution, flawed as it may be, outweighs any random regulation he rescinded through executive fiat. i just want to take a moment to remember the time he wanted to know if he could rescind birthright citizenship from the 14th amendment by an executive order. i also don’t claim, and never have, to believe that the president is the end-all be-all of our government, or even the most important person in it most of the time. the presidency is certainly the epitome of the binary trap our government has put us in. it’s a shame that it’s the only race most people even pay attention to. personally, i voted for the progressive da here in philly and the working families party for city council. i see you’re a fellow pennsylvania, so you must know that our piece of shit legislature has more impact on us than almost anything the president typically does. i feel you on the primaries, too. and i’ll tell you biden certainly wasn’t my first choice this season, either. i take issue with your paragraph about whether your vote matters and the candidate selection process. at the federal level, i’d largely agree. at the local level, i would not. sure, there is machinery and politics around it all, but at the end of the day, people must actually choose to run for office. turns out political types are the most likely to do that, who would have guessed. any 3rd party or multiparty system is also going to attract political animals, i don’t see any western democracy without some degree of this problem. but in philly we managed to kick a republican out of his charity seat that is all but guaranteed by the machine that had to kick some crumbs to the gop for whatever reason. on trying to subvert the election and foreign interference, i don’t think any of the things you’ve mentioned about israel or china are untrue, but i also don’t think they’re relevant to the charges here. obviously, the influence of super pacs and foreign money is getting more and more difficult to overcome. that doesn’t mean we should be ambivalent about whether russian oligarchs are funneling money to the gop through the nra. or trump’s attempt to open fake, politically motivated investigations with foreign government for the purpose of getting the media to cover it. speaking of the media, i don’t know how the media would cover dws’s consideration of using the religious angle to attack bernie in the press if 1) they never did it and 2) the emails didn’t leak. as it was, they reported a lot on the email leaks and a lot on her basement email server, too. why didn’t the american people need to know that the trump campaign was subject to a counterintelligence investigation until after the election (remember, investigations are based on probable cause, not smoking gun proof) but it was paramount that we be kept breathlessly updated on the emails right up to election day. if you’re making an honest assessment of trump’s character for his *entire* career, there’s no other conclusion than to know that he would cheat to overthrow the election if he could figure out how to make it work. sure, there are perfectly valid legal challenge to bring after elections and some of his fit that description. there should certainly be paper trails and audits after almost every election, in my opinion. the trouble comes with he and his associates routinely go on the news or twitter or to friendly gop state legislatures to make fake arguments that they aren’t making in court. they have no legal bearing and pose no risk of overturning the election, but the president appears to want his followers to believe they will. when trump lies on twitter about what happened on election day, that’s the thing he is choosing to **do** with the power of his office. and it’s not the big bad media, it’s the man himself no matter where or to whom he is speaking. to be sure, i am happier that trump is gone than i am happy that biden specifically is president. but where you were pro-gay marriage before it was cool, i was a gay person as happy to see civil unions gaining ground as i am to see biden elected. i watched gay marriage work its way across the country, and every single step of the way it came down to a handful of luckily placed governors or judges who are all nothing more than corporate shills to the jaded. but my life path **fundamentally changed** because corporate shill barack obama decided not to put the full-throated legal defense of the us to the task of defending the defense of marriage act. even corporate shill bill clinton’s dadt was a step up from it being illegal to be gay in the military, not that i wouldn’t have used that excuse to gtfo if i had to. just like legalizing weed and forgiving the people that got caught will fundamentally change so many people’s lives even if joe biden doesn’t strip amazon for parts and deliver it unto the people. two more things: china doesn’t own as much of our debt as you think, and that’s not even the problem that it’s made out to be (by the media). most us debt is in the hands of americans, about 78% or $21 trillion. i’m surprised you don’t see that the corporate shillification and takeover of our government is basically the path to fascism for the person who comes along and manages to take it. could’ve been trump, especially if he stopped thinking about reelection.",Negative

josprs3,PoliticalDiscussion,2023-06-20,1936,"the short answer is republicans are far far more ruthless when it comes to the consolidation of power. whereas democrats would likely use a filibuster free senate as part of a federal trifecta to enact policy priorities with regard to social welfare and environmental concerns, the gop would use it to lock democrats out of power immediately and in perpetuity (and now that they have a compliant scotus backstopping them, there would be no recourse whereas that same supreme court could strike down whatever big d democratic laws it felt like for whatever spurious reason it concocted). the longer answer is that since the modern configuration of the parties is primarily broken down along urban/rural, education and racial lines and all of those factors favor the gop with regard to the intersection of the country’s population distribution and equal suffrage of the senate, the default setting of that chamber right now is a republican majority. go down the list of swing states at the presidential level and look how well democrats have had to do in senate races to eke out a 51 seat majority—they’ve now swept az, ga, nv, mi & pa and thanks to gop incumbents in me & wi are having to rely on *way* behind enemy lines holds in mt, oh & wv. the next three closest states are nc, fl & tx which were ≈r+6, +7 & +9 in 2020 (and after that, it gets **real** ugly). a pronounced multi-cycle blue wave gets you to maybe 56 seats. a multi cycle red wave easily gets you to 62 and could in theory get all the way to 68. imagine a senate where everyone to the left of mitch mcconnell could vote no and a bill could still pass… so tl,dr: democrats aren’t blowing up the filibuster because they can’t capitalize on that change in any meaningful fashion given the present configuration and composition of the parties and scotus and don’t have the votes to change those things via expanding scotus or admitting new states even if they wanted to.",Negative

( a majority of green voters do not vote democrat so even if the green party did not run hillary still would have lost, gore still would have lost etc...) the larger loss was losing out on left voters and non voters (50ish% of the country does not vote) by running a status quo campaign. had obama and the democrats simply not broken so many promises over the years i think clinton would have won with her platform and campaign promises which were acceptable from a left perspective, but combining the clear bias towards clinton over sanders during the primary process by the leadership and the past decades of democrats breaking promises and shifting to the right. clinton was unable to win over enough of the left. the democrats had lost the trust they had built with the left. but then after a trump term people could clearly see how bad he was so voters came out in record numbers to oppose him. in 2020. but here we are again in 2024 the democrats are actively supporting a genocide in gaza with out restraint. so no doubt once again many on the left who would used to have supported the democratic party are hesitating. that is all. that is why democrats are losing. they raise up their opponents (extreme republicans,) push down their allies (the left,) and they serve the establishment and their donors over their voters.

gnt3alo,PoliticalDiscussion,2021-02-17,1681,"> look, americans would probably be in favor of partial (20-30k) loan forgiveness if the fundamental problems driving high loans were resolved. immigration has the same problem, and amnesty solutions have been floated for decades. the problem is, forgiveness/amnesty is only half of the solution. the other half is to fix the fundamental problem, otherwise you're just putting a bandaid on a festering wound. imo, i don't think student loan debt is really a problem. average (mean or median) debt load is around $17-35k, depending on how its measure. this is roughly the cost of a new car. lifetime increased earnings from having a degree are vastly in excess of this cost, so a degree pays for itself many times over. the real area for forgiveness could be people who took on debt but failed to graduated. this population has the worst of both worlds; they have debt and they don't have the lifetime increased earnings i'm vehemently against forgiveness for people who graduated, have degrees, and have significantly higher earnings than people who didn't graduate. the higher income brackets don't need a bailout. i'm all for forgiving people who have debt without a degree, though schools and lenders need to be responsible to some degree for issuing bad loans, and for allowing people to attend and fail. this doesn't mean everyone should automatically graduate regardless of grades. instead, it means schools need to put more effort into figuring out why people are failing, and to offer additional assistance to those with poor grades so they don't flunk out. this includes mental health assistance. depression and nervous breakdowns are common among that age group.",Neutral

lxoqecr,PoliticalDiscussion,2024-11-18,2409,"> why are us soldiers lives more important than japanese children? part of what tips the balance in this question is what allied troops had seen during their island hopping campaign across the pacific. it's hard for a modern person to really conceptualize how... fanatical... the japanese were during the war. suicidal charges into machine gun fire, families executing murder/suicide pacts when their island was captured, soldiers disguising themselves as dead and then pulling pins on grenades when allied soldiers walked close and actually wounded soldiers doing the same, setting up prepubescent children with sniper rifles to wait for the allies to come in range, crazy stuff. every country saw some of that behavior, but it was much more common from the japanese for some reason. and they were training the entire population, including women and children, to fight with bamboo spears if the home islands were invaded. to give a perspective on the resistance that us leaders were expecting: the us made a supply of purple heart medals to give to wounded soldiers during an invasion of the home islands, and they were still giving those medals to soldiers in iraq and afghanistan even after the wars in korea and vietnam. so it's not unlikely that those japanese children were going to be pressed into attacking us soldiers, and many of them dying in the attempt. add the firebombing that the us conducted on top of that; conventional bombs that razed the wooden japanese cities to the ground in numbers dwarfing nagasaki and hiroshima. those were no less horrific for not being nuclear, and somehow still accepted in a world that had seen the blitz in the uk and the bombing of dresden and other german cities. there's an amazing wwii podcast from dan carlin on the topic, and he compares the war efforts to a ""human being lawnmower"" with every day the machines kept running leading to a reliably huge number of people being killed. i don't value japanese children more than us soldiers. to end the war without the atomic bombs being dropped, you would have likely seen even more children dying than you did in those two cities as the human being lawnmower passed over the entire japanese countryside. hopefully, the shock of the atomic bombs made the machine stop sooner and spared more people than letting it continue to run. it's not an easy choice, but i think truman made the right one.",Neutral

doesn't that make you worry about corrupt corporations? government expansion is in many areas different from corporate expansion. sure, they do share similarities but my argument is that government expansion is often if not always far more concerning, catastrophic and consenquential. the reason being is because governments own an absolute monopoly on force, jurisdiction, coercion, and the violences thereof. however, private companies cannot successfully formulate such large monopolies due the intensively competitive nature of the market. even if such large monopolies do form, they are unmaintainable due to the same reason. governments rely entirely on force (taxation) to fufil their revenues while private companies rely entirely on voluntary transactions to fufil their revenues, that is why state expansion and corruption is far more worrysome. >what about fixing problems that the government didn't create? the government is not always inefficient at what they do, they can successfully avoid problems. however, the government often times makes dire flaws when managing problems it both did and did not create. with regards to economics and the market, it is a very well-structured and self-regulating process if done in a laissez-faire manner. i'd say for most scenarios, it is important to not trust the government when dealing with problems it created and it's important to be highly skeptical when it deals with problems it hasn't created. >no, but i'll trust democratically-elected officials over unelected oligarchs. i wouldn't trust either regardless, no matter if one is preferable than the other. i'd rather get a bruise than a gash but i'd rather not get hurt in the first place. also, democratically-elected leaders have also created unelected oligarchs via their policies and laws, look at the current us and post-soviet union era. >prove it. there are many situations and logics that can lead to my argument being proved but considering that there are a large number, i'll zone in on a few examples. first, patent laws. the entire logic behind patent laws are to inherently give private companies a legal protection against competitors in regards to intellectual property, this does not inherently cause monopolies but it does incentive oligarchic-like tendencies, such as ""lawsuits by 'patent trolls' who 'specialize in amassing patent portfolios for the purpose of initiating lawsuits' now make up 62 percent of all infringement suits, at a direct cost of $29 billion in 2011."" - *brookings.edu.* other examples of government-granted monopolies via financial assistance include energy/power services, roads, and so on. those are monopolies that age directly granted by the government. other dire mentions include financial institutions that are ""too big too fail."" the government has engaged in making sure that banks that are ""too big to fail"" do not collapse at about any cost, this was popularized during the 2008 financial crisis. this ensures that those banks remain monopolized via government intervention. >why don't they just tax the rich to tax the rich? here's a guy with a billion dollars. we want to tax him for one million dollars. enforcement of that tax will cost us ten thousand dollars. ergo, we tax him for one million ten thousand dollars. done and done. you can't just tax the rich and refuse to tax everyone else, although rich people do have a lot of money, you can't solely rely on millionaires and billionaires to fund an empire worth trillions. in addition, there's simply not enough billionaires and ""ultra-rich"" citizens to fund all government expenditures, that includes the irs and tax collection services. there's a reason you can't rely on 20% of people to fund the other 80%. in addition, such policies will only incentivize tax evasion and it will create far more heavy financial burdens on the rich to the point that massive wage cuts and unemployments will occur because most of the time, the rich people are the ones employing the lower and middle income people. >what if we wrote the tax code to be less evade-able? this is nearly impossible because overtime, higher income individuals will invest money in finding new ways to evade taxes, especially if they are high. rich people are more willing to pay taxes if the taxes are lower and more preferable to pay, hence the laffer curve. >how often? according to brookings.edu, about one in every six dollars owed in federal taxes are not paid in the us. it's very, very often.",Negative

lvpcub5,PoliticalDiscussion,2024-11-06,1757,"what i find surprising is the margin by which trump has won this time. both elections previously, he lost the popular vote, and by no small amount either, even his victory in 2016 was marked by a 3 million popular vote difference against him. votes are still being counted even with the race being called, but as of right now trump is leading harris in the popular vote by nearly 5 million, but turnout is still significantly lower than 2020 to the tune of about 20 million votes lower across both parties. i think harris had no real way to combat trump's attacks tying her to biden's administration. trump's turnout is roughly the same thus far as in 2020, whereas kamala's 66 million votes thus far starkly pales to biden's winning 84 million from 4 years ago. i think just as many people turned back to trump from biden as turned away from trump with all his legal and character problems. i think i personally put the blame for this loss squarely on biden's shoulders. he had a bad 4 years to begin with, and i think that the decision to proceed with his campaign despite his popularity problems was arrogant and ultimately ruinous for democrats this year. dropping out and endorsing kamala was not only too little too late, but also hurtful to harris' campaign out of the gate, with many voters feeling they weren't given a choice in their candidate (which tbf, they weren't) and giving harris only 3 - 4 months to convince voters that she was the right choice. i think kamala did the best with what she was given, but ultimately biden's stain on her campaign was enough to sink her. if i wasn't convinced before, i am now that the democratic party is too divided and out of touch to take on anyone that utters the words 'immigration' or 'economy.'",Negative
